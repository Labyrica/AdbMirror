# Phase 3: Mirror UI - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Dashboard-style UI with all key info and controls visible at once. The Mirror button is the hero element — big and prominent — with device info and settings supporting it rather than competing for attention.

When a user opens the app, they should instantly know what to do. The layout matches the existing WPF AdbMirror app, ported to Avalonia with the dark FluentAvaloniaUI theme.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Instant clarity** — User knows exactly what to do within 2 seconds of opening
- **Polished feel** — Looks professional and refined, like a finished product
- **Zero friction** — Start mirroring with absolute minimum clicks/decisions

All three are equally important. This is a consumer app, not a power-user tool.

## Specific Ideas

- Match the existing WPF AdbMirror UI layout and behavior
- Action-centric design: big Mirror button as the hero
- Dashboard style: device info, quality selector, and options visible upfront (not hidden in menus)
- Dark theme (already established in Phase 1)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Core value reminder: "One-click mirroring that just works."

The UI should feel like a simple utility, not enterprise software. Device status, mirror control, quality preset, and key options all visible at a glance.
